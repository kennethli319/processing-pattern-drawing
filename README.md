Patternator is a CAD program which can optimize the process of drawing patterned art or mandalas. It integrates the knowledge of Mathematics (trigonometry, coordinate geometry), Computer Science (programming) and Visual Art. It helps designers to improve the efficiency in creating patterned art.

By using Patternator, it can simplify the process of creating a pat- terned art and thus enhance the efficiency. All users need to do is to click on the mouse, then Patternator will automatically generate lines according to the rules of a selected symmetry or rotation.
It allows people in all ages and all professions experience the beau- ty of art by creating tilings or infinite knots.
